        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="cover.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Yesterday is the graduation day of my school (JAIST). It really a nice day for my seniors to get their graduated certificate. I can see the satisfaction on their face. Someone will be continuing their PhD degree, but someone will find a job in Japan and start their ‘busy’ life. Although their future-goal are different, they are really happy when getting the achievements for their efforts after 2 years far away from home. Student life away from home does not easy to pass. You have to face a lot of difficulties in a daily life such as the homesickness, living cost,  relationship problems, etc. However, those things will give you unforgettable memories and good experiences for you in the future. Similarly, my seniors also paid a lot of efforts for their degree at JAIST and finally they leave JAIST with their pride. In the life, there are some friends who can make you happy, angry, or sad. However, if you no longer meet them, you will feel empty.  Now I am a second year master student that means I will graduate in the next year and I am wondering that “What I need to prepare for my graduation and for my career?”, there are a lot of messy things in my mind.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After 8 months I went to Japan, I have submitted my first research result to the International Conference - GALA (Games and Learning Alliance). Fortunately, my research was high evaluated so that I had a chance to present my research to many international researchers in Netherland. This achievement is the worth result of a lot of effort of mine in the research under supervision of Professor Iida. GALA conference is the famous conference for the Serious Game and Gamifcation topics. The commitees of this conference come from many countries in Europe such as France, Italia, and Germany. My research aimed at analyzing and evaluating the use of game elements in education. That is a reason why I have an invitation to go to GALA. </p><p>After I submitted the research paper publication result and the invitation to my university, I got a grant for my conference trip (around 40,000JPY). In this trip, I went with 2 guys in my laboratory and Professor Iida helps us in a flight ticket and hotel reservation. This was really the most longest flight in whole of my life. We first flight from Komatsu Airport (the nearest airport from my university) to the Tokyo, Haneda airport and then from Haneda to Frankurt (Germary). Finally, we arrived Amasterdam at 8:00 pm.  </p><p>In Amsterdam, we are welcomed by my colleague’s cousin (a Chinese guy). My first impression about him is “Wow, a Amsterdam playboy”. He takes us to a Chinese restaurant to have dinner and then we go around Amsterdam, of couse a Red district is also included. This is very first time for me to go around a Red disctrict, it is really interesting experience. Next, we went to a “weed” store and I have been noticed that “Coffee shop” and “Cafe shop” is totally different in Netherland. After all, we started to go to Utrect city and arrived our hotel at 12 pm and finish a long day.</p><p><img src="cover.jpg" alt=""></p><p> I have had a nice trip in the Netherlands where I would like to come back again. I very love an atmosphere and an ancient architecture in the Europe. Those reflect the very long-term development of European history. Walking around a down town of Utrecht city makes me feel that I was falling in the Harry Potter’s world. The cold air, yellow light, vintage house, etc. those make me feel that I am living in the 18th century. Moreover, Netherland is a board games country. I found various types of board games in many store. If you are a board-game fan, I think Netherlands is really a good place to live in the rest of your life.</p><p> Finally, I completed successfully my presentaion and came back to Japan. It is really a nice trip I never had before. My research is commented by many PhD and professor in the conference. Those comments are good contributions which helps my research moves forward. If you are interesting to my research, you can find a introduction below.</p><h1 id="Analyzing-Gamification-of-“Duolingo”-with-focus-on-Its-Course-Structure"><a href="#Analyzing-Gamification-of-“Duolingo”-with-focus-on-Its-Course-Structure" class="headerlink" title="Analyzing Gamification of “Duolingo” with focus on Its Course Structure"></a>Analyzing Gamification of “Duolingo” with focus on Its Course Structure</h1><h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract:"></a>Abstract:</h2><p>Gamification is the application of game-based elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts. Many learning platforms have applied gamification to increase motivation and engagement. Duolingo is a popular language learning platform which has applied gamification.</p><p>In this paper, game refinement measure is employed to evaluate the gamification of Duolingo. The results show that the range of game refinement value of Duolingo is reasonable in such as serious environment.
